## Source Database Descriptions 

The consolidated dataset used in this study was aggregated from eleven distinct databases, originating from nine countries. The collection protocols for all public data were approved by their respective institutional ethics committees in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. 

**1. BIOMARKERS (BD_001)** 

The Biomarkers database is an internal dataset from the Grupo Neuropsicología y Conducta (GRUNECO) and Grupo de Neurociencias de Antioquia (GNA) that focuses on the longitudinal follow-up of individuals across the Alzheimer’s disease continuum. This includes participants ranging from preclinical stages (carriers of the PSEN1 E280A mutation) to clinical stages (MCI and dementia), as well as HC. 

EEG data were recorded using a Neuroscan amplifier (Neuroscan Medical System, Neuro-soft Inc., Sterling, VA, USA) with a 58-channel tin electrode cap positioned according to the international 10-10 system. The reference electrode was placed on the right earlobe, and the ground electrode was placed between Cz and Fz. The signals were acquired at a sampling frequency of 1000 Hz and filtered online using a bandpass filter (0.05 to 200 Hz) and a band-reject filter at 60 Hz to eliminate power line noise.  

**2. BRAINLAT (BD_002)**

 A multimodal dataset from the Latin American Brain Health Institute (BrainLat) in Argentina and Chile, publicly available on Synapse (syn51549340). It includes HC, AD, and FTD cohorts. Data was acquired with a 128-channel Biosemi Active-two system (Prado et al., 2023). 

**3. CHMBP (BD_003)** 

The Cuban Human Brain Mapping Project (CHBMP) repository (Valdes-Sosa et al., 2021) is an open multimodal neuroimaging and cognitive dataset containing data from 282 young and middle-aged healthy participants, ranging from 18 to 68 years. Data was acquired between 2004 and 2008. Resting-state EEG was recorded using the MEDICID 5 system, equipped with 64 and 128 electrodes, differential amplifiers, and a gain of 10,000. The amplifiers applied three filters: 1) a low-cut filter (high-pass, first-order, -3dB at 6dB/octave), 2) a high-cut filter (low-pass, Butterworth, second order, -3dB at 12dB/octave), and 3) a line filter with a unit frequency response. The electrodes were placed according to the 10–10 International System with a custom electrode cap, and the linked earlobes were used as EEG reference. Electrode impedances were considered acceptable if they were below 5 k Ω. Bandpass filter settings were 0.5 to 50 Hz with a 60 Hz notch filter, and the sampling rate was 200 Hz. 

The dataset is hosted on the Synapse platform (dataset accession: syn22283677) in BIDS format and is also available in the Longitudinal Online Research and Imaging System (LORIS) v20.2. Includes comprehensive data on age, sex, years of education, handedness, and cognitive test results from the MMSE. 

The Cuban Human Brain Mapping Project (CHBMP), a public normative dataset of 282 healthy adults (18-68 years) available on Synapse (syn22283677). Data was acquired with a MEDICID 5 system (64 or 128 channels, 10-10) at 200 Hz. 

**4. DORTMUND (BD_004)** 

The "Dortmund Vital Study," a public prospective dataset on healthy cognitive aging from OpenNeuro (ds005385). The sample includes 608 healthy participants aged 20-70. Data was acquired with a 64-channel BrainVision BrainAmp DC (10-20) at 1000 Hz (Getzmann et al., 2024). 

**5. GRECIA (BD_005)** 

A public dataset from AHEPA General Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece, available on OpenNeuro (ds004504). The cohort includes 88 subjects: 36 AD, 23 FTD, and 29 HC. Data was acquired with a 19-channel Nihon Kohden system (10-20) at 500 Hz (Koutsoniotis et al., 2023). 

**6. POLONIA (BD_006)** 

The PEARL-Neuro dataset from Poland, publicly available on OpenNeuro (ds004796). It contains 79 healthy middle-aged adults (50-63 years). Data was acquired with a 128-channel Brain Products actiCHamp system at 1000 Hz (Dzianok & Kublik, 2024). 

**7. PORTABLES (BD_007)** 

A low-density EEG dataset collected by the GRUNECO and GNA research groups at Universidad de Antioquia, Colombia (Project PRG 2022-53407). The cohort includes 50 healthy controls and 8 MCI patients. Data was acquired with an 8-channel OpenBCI Cyton (10-10) at 250 Hz. 

**8. SRM (BD_008)** 

The Stimulus-Selective Response Modulation dataset from the University of Oslo, Norway, available on OpenNeuro (ds003775). It consists of 111 healthy controls. Data was acquired with a 64-channel BioSemi ActiveTwo (10-10) at 1024 Hz (Hatlestad-Hall et al., 2022). 

**9. DUQUE (BD_009):**  

A dataset from Universidad de Antioquia, Colombia, focusing on the PSEN1 E280A genetic mutation. The cohort includes asymptomatic carriers, symptomatic carriers, and non-carrier healthy controls (77 participants total). Data was acquired with a 64-channel Neuroscan system (10-10) at 1000 Hz. 

**10. PARKINSON (BD_010)** 

A dataset from the Grupo de Neurociencias de Antioquia, Colombia, comparing 36 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with 36 matched healthy controls. Data was acquired with a 58-channel system (10-10) at 1000 Hz. 

**11. CAUEEG (BD_011)** 

The Chung-Ang University Hospital EEG dataset from South Korea, restricted for academic use. It was designed for classifying HC, MCI, and dementia, as described in (Kim et al. 2023). Data was acquired with a 19-channel Comet AS40 system (10-20) at 200 Hz.
